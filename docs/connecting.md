# Connecting PM3 to Android devices

Note: these instructions **do not work** for Android Runtime for ChromeOS (ARC).

Your first stop should be the [compatibility list][compat].

## Types of connectors

### Bluetooth

Proxmark RDV4.0 has a Bluetooth module.  We don't support this, or its USB dongle yet.

You need to use plain USB instead.

### TCP/IP

To my knowledge, there is no PM3 device with TCP/IP support.

TCP support is to allow [easy debugging with the Android Emulator](./debugging/android-emulator.md).
That document also describes how to set up `socat` to redirect a locally connected PM3 device over
TCP.

### USB-A

These are "regular USB ports" that are on most PCs. They are also present on some Android tablets,
TVs, and set top boxes.

Nothing really special is needed here -- you should be able to plug devices in without any special
adapters.

For mains-powered devices, you're unlikely to have [power issues](#power-issues).

If a device has this port, try this first.

### USB Mini-B

This port is fairly uncommon on Android devices.  This has the same requirements as USB Micro-B (see
below).

### USB Micro-B

This port is commonly found on Android devices produced before 2016, and is also present on some
Android set top boxes.

You'll need a [USB On-The-Go (OTG)][usb-otg] adapter to plug in USB devices.

Devices typically only supply 100 mA through the port, so you will likely have [power
issues](#power-issues).  Some devices do not implement USB-OTG correctly.

### USB C

This port is commonly found on Android devices produced after 2016.

You'll need a USB C to A adapter to plug in USB devices.  You cannot use a USB C to Micro B adapter.

Power delivery out of the port is variable, and depends on your device, and the USB C adapter that
you are using.  All USB C cables and adapters contain microcontrollers at the USB C ends of the
cable, to negotiate power levels.  As a result, you are [likely to have power issues](#power-issues)
with phones and tablets.

## Initial test

Before connecting the PM3, you should test that other USB devices work correctly in Android.

First you should test that your cables work by connecting a USB Mouse to your device.  It should
light up and display a cursor on-screen when you move it.

## Common issues

Use the _System Info_ to show what USB devices AndProx can see.  You should see:

* `USB Host: yes`

  If it says "no", [your device doesn't support USB
  Host](./compatibility.md#known-incompatible-devices).

* Found 1 or more USB Devices: `9ac4:4b8f`

  If it shows `2d2d:504d` -- you have old firmware and need to upgrade.

  If it shows some other ID -- you may have a third-party firmware and should switch to mainline.

  Some devices have WiFi/Bluetooth radios connected over USB, you can ignore those. They'll stay in
  the list even when nothing is plugged in.

  If it shows nothing, then your device isn't exposing USB devices properly, or may have the
  `cdc_acm` kernel module loaded when it shouldn't.

* Found 1 suitable drivers; `CdcAcmSerialPort`

  If it shows no suitable drivers, but the correct IDs are showing, then this is probably a
  firmware issue. You need to run mainline firmware.

### Power issues

Some devices don't supply enough power for PM3 (150 mA). To get extra power, you need a USB OTG
Y-cable or USB Mini-B Y-cable, and an external power source (like a USB battery pack).  There are
two degrees of issues with this:

* **Devices which don't supply power at all:** these always need a Y-cable to work. Some devices,
  like _Nexus 4_, have `android.hardware.usb.host` disabled, and will require a third-party Android
  distribution to enable the functionality.

* **Needed for HF:** these supply about 100 mA, and this is not quite enough for HF cards. Commands
  may not work as expected, or at all.  Sometimes, the PM3 will just hang.

### Product Name bug

Android devices from many manufacturers have a "product name" bug, where they do not present USB
devices to applications if they have an invalid USB Product Name.

Many versions of the Proxmark3 firmware have a glitch where they only respond to USB String
Descriptor requests for a product name after about a second.  This is long enough to time out.

[Proxmark3 PR#565][6] resolves this issue -- which requires reflashing the device firmware.
