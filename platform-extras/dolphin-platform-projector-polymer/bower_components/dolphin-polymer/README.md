The Dolphin Platform is a framework that implements the presentation model pattern and provides a modern way to create enterprise applications. The Platform provides several client implementations that all can be used in combination with a general sever API.

By doing so you can create enterprise application with a single server and several desktop, web and mobile client implementations. Here the Dolphin Platforms define a mechanism to automatically snchronize models between the server and the client.
