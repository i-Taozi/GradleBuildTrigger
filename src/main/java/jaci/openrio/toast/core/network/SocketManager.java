/**
 * The class responsible for managing Socket communication between Toast Modules and other programs running
 * on the Driver Station. This class implements the NetworkDelegate API in order to make sure modules do
 * not conflict on sockets, as well as making sure sockets are within the limits FMS provides, having only
 * 10 sockets available, specifically, 5800-5810. This SocketManager listens on ports 5806-5807, having the
 * master socket on port 5805. It is recommended to look though the NetworkDelegate API Documentation for
 * more information regarding the master-slave socket lifecycle. Ports 5800-5804 are left open for communication
 * that requires a specific protocol, such as the WebUI that needs a HTTP communication. Unless you absolutely
 * require a specific socket, it is highly recommended you use this class.
