/**
 * The 'Heartbeat' is a class that keeps a constant ticking routine. The timing between these routines is the same for each
 * tick, (100ms/50Hz), meaning tasks that require a scheduled timer may find this useful. Additionally, the Heartbeat will keep track
 * of the time required for each 'beat'. If a beat takes longer than the Heart Rate (100ms), the heartbeat will 'skip', and will
 * pass an argument to all the listeners that contains the number of beat(s) that were skipped. The difference in time between
 * each beat is therefore guaranteed to be a modulus of the Heart Rate (100ms).
 *
 * Additionally, the Heartbeat Thread will only be alive if there are Listeners in the array. This means the Heartbeat will
 * not tick if there is nothing to execute, making sure not to waste system resources.
