/**
 * A Non-Vital Load Task is a task that starts initialization with Toast's Bootstrapper, but isn't necessarily
 * a requirement later on in the load process. These Load Tasks are started at Toast Bootstrap, and load in their
 * own Thread. From there on, the task will load and not cause any blocking on the main thread, reducing startup
 * time. If a module requires the use of the task, the Task will block the thread (join) and wait until loading
 * is complete before advancing. This method enables lengthy tasks (such as JavaScript engine preparation) to be
 * threaded and only be waited on if they are required for a task. If the loading is already complete, the thread
 * will not block and will be allowed to continue immediately.
