	<dt>Why is there no case-insensitive search?</dt>
	<dd>
		Well, to be honest, this has two reasons:
		<ul>
			<li>Case-insensitive searching has quite a performance impact because every checked String has
				to be either lower- or uppercased.<br/>
				Beside that, lower- and uppercasing is Locale-dependent.
				This means that there is no way to do it reliably for every given unicode string.
			</li>
			<li>I have simply no idea how to add that option in a way that is both userfriendly and
				applicable to the current condition implementation.
			</li>
			<li>It's pretty easy to do it yourself - in the way expected by you - using <a
				href="conditions.xhtml#groovy">groovy conditions</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>Why is there no tree-view of the logger names as <a href="http://logging.apache.org/chainsaw/">Chainsaw</a>
		and <a href="http://vigilog.sourceforge.net/">Vigilog</a> have?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		One of the problems I'm facing is the (possibly) large amount of events I'm supporting.<br/>
		This means that the logger names need to be saved upon reception separately from the events themselves.
		Otherwise all events would need scanning if an inactive logging files was reopened and this would
		take quite some time.<br/>
		Something like that is in development but it doesn't have a very high priority right now for the
		following reasons:
		<ul>
			<li>I, personally, didn't use Chainsaws tree-view very much.</li>
			<li>You can get a similar behavior using the filters already present in Lilith.</li>
			<li>The tree-view itself would use valuable space on the screen. even if it could be toggled on and off.
			</li>
			<li>I'm currently not in the mood to implement it just for "me too" reasons.</li>
		</ul>
