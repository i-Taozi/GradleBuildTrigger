WebSocket Readme
================

This simple app demonstrates using WebSocket with Baratine(tm) service.

To run the service start Baratine(tm) with --deploy websocket.jar.

$ bin/baratine start --deploy examples/websocket.jar

Open page index.html in a browser with WebSocket support.

Move your mouse over canvas. As the mouse passes over the canvas a red dot is
drawn and mouse coordinates are sent to /mouse-tracker service deployed from
websocket.jar. Service /mouse-tracker echoes the coordinates back to the page
and as soon as the page receives the message with coordinates it draws a green
dot using the echoed coordinates. Deployed locally one may never see the red
dots.

Code used to send the coordinates can be found in method drawAndSend().

Code used to receive and extract the echoed coordinates is in .onmessage()
handler of the WebSocket.

When opened from file system the page opens WebSocket at localhost port 8085.
