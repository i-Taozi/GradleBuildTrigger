/**
 * This class is a handler for handling fertilizing in the Farming Station.
 * <p>
 * In order for an item to be usable as fertilizer, it must have a handler. The handler needs to be registered in the
 * {@link net.minecraftforge.event.RegistryEvent.Register}&lt;IFertilizer&gt; event.
 * <p>
 * The handler's {@link #matches(ItemStack)} method will be called on two different occasions. First to check if an item can be inserted into the fertilizer
 * slot (on both client and server), second to select the correct handler when trying to apply the fertilizer (server only).
 * <p>
 * The {@link #apply(ItemStack, EntityPlayer, World, BlockPos)} method will then be called to execute applying the fertilizer. It is responsible for checking if
 * the target block can be fertilized and then doing the actual fertilizing. If it wants to play sounds or spawn FX (green particles), is has to do so, too.
 * (Note that the purple Farming Station particles will be added by the Farming Station.) It then has to return the changed itemStack.
 * <p>
 * If the fertilizer item is some kind of container item (e.g. a bucket, or an RF powered item) and got useless for fertilizing after being used, you can put it
 * into any inventory slot of the {@link FakePlayer} to be dumped into the Farming Station's output slots.
