		<h2>Changes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Change of active Conditions was not repainting views. This was only the case in internal betas.
			<br/>This was reported by Alfred.
			<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/75">Ticket 75</a>)			
			</li>
			
			<li>
			Removed additivity from the debug loggers. Debug logger events won't show up in the
			Lilith log or the console.
			</li>

			<li>
			Prevented duplicate start of application by the same user.
			<br/>Duplicate startup by a different user is still possible but quite useless until the event receivers are configurable.
			<br/>This was requested by Joe.
			<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/74">Ticket 74</a>)			
			</li>

			<li>
			Enhanced debug dialog. Better layout and tooltips.
			</li>
			
			<li>
			Added option to disable the creation of statistics.
			<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/4">Ticket 4</a>)			
			</li>

			<li>
			Added "Copy call location" action. This is quite useful in combination with the
			CallLocation condition.
			</li>
			
			<li>
			Added CallLocation condition that returns true if the first element of the call stack
			equals the given StackTraceElement.
			</li>

			<li>
			Added option to disable global logs.
			<br/>This was requested by Joe.
			<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/73">Ticket 73</a>)			
			</li>

			Preventing saved conditions with duplicate name or condition.
			</li>

			</li>

			<li>

			<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/70">Ticket 70</a>)

			<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/68">Ticket 68</a>)			
			</li>

			</li>

			</li>

			This was reported by Joe.
			<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/66">Ticket 66</a>)			
			</li>

			<li>
			Preferences dialog can now be closed by pressing Enter.<br/>
			This was suggested by Vlad Satanovski.
			</li>

			<li>
			Table and message view are now having reasonable preferred sizes (needed because of splitpane).
			</li>

			<li>
			Replaced tabs of event view with a combobox.<br/>
			The combobox is only visible if there are filtered views. There's also more room
			for the condition string.<br/>
			Something like this was suggested by Scott Stanton and Joe.
			<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/58">Ticket 58</a>)			
			</li>

			<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/65">Ticket 65</a>)			
			</li>

			<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/59">Ticket 59</a>)			
			</li>

			<li>
			Events did sometimes show up twice in filtered views.

		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<ul>
		
			<li>Mac OS X 10.5 + 10.6:
			<br/>Shortcuts/Accelerators are not working if both the "Tip of the Day" and "Check for Update" dialogs show after startup.
			<br/>This seems to be a bug in the Java implementation from Apple.
			<br/>See <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/72">Ticket 72</a>.
			</li>
		
			<li>Selection in the HTML view is currently somewhat buggy, especially in case of scaled view.
				This is a limitation of Flying Saucer that's used as the XHTML renderer.
			</li>
