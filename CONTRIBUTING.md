General Contribution Tips
=========================

We welcome any contributions that make Dynamometer more reliable, accurate, usable,
or extensible. It is generally preferred that new features and behaviors should be
configurable unless sufficient discussion is held to determine that there is no
situation in which the previous behavior is desirable. GitHub issues are the
appropriate forum for such discussions.
