### Code style

We are trying to keep an consistant coding convention in order to help readablility and make it easy to submit code.

Things to refrain from:
  * Different indentation in the same file
  * Too long lines 200 chars+
  * All curly brackets starts at the same line as function, class, method, expression, what ever.
  * All curly brackets ends on a new line.
