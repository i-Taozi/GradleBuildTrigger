/**
 * Fsync service batches fsync requests to the underlying store.
 * 
 * The fsync only occurs at batch time, and when the fsyncs are flushed.
 * 
 * Fsync clients allocate a sequence after their data is written before
 * requesting the fsync itself. The sequence allows for fsyncs that occur
 * after data is written but before the service message is received, avoiding
 * duplicates.
 * 
 * <code><pre>
 * [write data]
 * sequence = fsync.allocateFsyncSequence();
 * fsync.fsync(sequence, result);
 * </pre></code>
 * 
 * Or if the client knows it's batching several fsyncable calls, it can
 * schedule the fsync, but not flush it until all are completed
 * 
 * <code><pre>
 * while (...) {
 *   [write data]
 *   sequence = fsync.allocateFsyncSequence();
 *   fsync.scheduleFsync(sequence, result);
 * }
 * fsync.flush();
 * </pre></code>
