FullscreenVideoView is a custom VideoView Android library which makes loading, setting up and going fullscreen for video views easy.

How to use FullscreenVideoView?
===
Declare the FullscreenVideoView in the XML layout file
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical">

    <bg.devlabs.fullscreenvideoview.FullscreenVideoView
        android:id="@+id/fullscreenVideoView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
</LinearLayout>
```

The Activity where the FullscreenVideoView is declared should handle configuration changes, which imposes this change in the AndroidManifest.xml file
```xml
<activity
    android:name="your_activity_name"
    android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize" />
```

### Network security configuration on Android API 23 or later

On devices with Android API 23 or later a network security configuration should be set up to allow the cleartext traffic.

- Add the XML tag `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` in the application tag in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- Add a `network_security_config.xml` file in the `res/xml` directory and add the domains that you want to use in your application. To use this network configuration it must be added in the application tag in `AndroidManifest.xml` (`android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config`).

### Basic video loading (from URL or from a file)
```kotlin
// Loading from URL
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
	...
	val fullscreenVideoView = findViewById(R.id.fullscreenVideoView)
	val videoUrl = "https://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/VfE_html5.mp4"
	fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
}

// Loading from file
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
	...
	val fullscreenVideoView = findViewById(R.id.fullscreenVideoView)
	val videoFile = new File("file_path")
	fullscreenVideoView.videoFile(videoFile)
}
```

### Change controls drawable resources

Java or Kotlin
```kotlin
fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
        .playDrawable(R.drawable.ic_play)
        .pauseDrawable(R.drawable.ic_pause)
        .fastForwardDrawable(R.drawable.ic_fast_forward)
        .rewindDrawable(R.drawable.ic_rewind)
        .enterFullscreenDrawable(R.drawable.ic_fullscreen)
        .exitFullscreenDrawable(R.drawable.ic_fullscreen_exit)
```

XML
```xml
<bg.devlabs.fullscreenvideoview.FullscreenVideoView
        android:id="@+id/fullscreenVideoView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:play_drawable="@drawable/ic_play"
        app:pause_drawable="@drawable/ic_pause"
        app:ffwd_drawable="@drawable/ic_fast_forward"
        app:rew_drawable="@drawable/ic_rewind"
        app:enter_fullscreen_drawable="@drawable/ic_fullscreen"
        app:exit_fullscreen_drawable="@drawable/ic_fullscreen_exit"/>
```

### Enable/disable controls

```kotlin
fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
        .disablePause()
        .addSeekBackwardButton()
        .addSeekForwardButton()
```

### Enable video auto-start

```kotlin
fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
        .enableAutoStart()
```

### Customize fast-forward and/or rewind seconds

```kotlin
fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
        .fastForwardSeconds(5)
        .rewindSeconds(5)
```

### Change the playback speed (only for API 23 and above)

There are 7 playback speed values which are added by default, but they can be changed with custom ones when `playbackSpeedOptions` is used.
```kotlin
val playbackOptions = PlaybackSpeedOptions().addSpeeds(0.25f, 0.5f, 0.75f, 1f)

fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
        .addPlaybackSpeedButton()
        .playbackSpeedOptions(playbackOptions)
```

### Add thumbnail

This feature supports loading only drawables from the Android project.
```kotlin
val thumbnailResId = R.drawable.video_thumbnail

fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
	.thumbnail(thumbnailResId)
```
### Play/Pause video programmatically

If you want to play/pause the video programmatically you can use the `play()/pause()` method.
```kotlin
fullscreenVideoView.play()
// OR
fullscreenVideoView.pause()
```

### Hide progress views

Hiding the progress views can be implemented initially from calling the Builder function or later by calling the view method.

```kotlin
// Hide initially from the Builder
fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
        .hideProgress()

// OR

// Hide by calling the view method
fullscreenVideoView.hideProgress()
```

### Hide fullscreen button

Hiding the fullscreen button can be implemented initially from calling the Builder function or later by calling the view method.

```kotlin
// Hide initially from the Builder
fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
        .hideFullscreenButton()

// OR

// Hide by calling the view method
fullscreenVideoView.hideFullscreenButton()
```

### Listen for errors

Listening for errors can be implemented initially from calling the Builder function or later by calling the view method.

```kotlin
// Add initially from the Builder
fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
        .addOnErrorListener(object : OnErrorListener {
                override fun onError(exception: FullscreenVideoViewException?) {
                        // Handle error
                }        
        })
        
// OR

// Add by calling the view method
fullscreenVideoView.addOnErrorListener(object : OnErrorListener {
        override fun onError(exception: FullscreenVideoViewException?) {
                // Handle error
        }    
})
```

### Listen for Media Controller events

To listen for Media Controller events you should use the Builder function `mediaControllerListener`. You can either pass the `MediaControllerListener` interface or `MediaControllerListenerAdapter` if don't need to use all of the methods of the interface.

```kotlin
// Using the MediaControllerListener interface
fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
	.mediaControllerListener(object : MediaControllerListener {
		    override fun onPlayClicked() {
                        // Do something when the play button is clicked
                    }

                    override fun onPauseClicked() {
                        // Do something when the pause button is clicked
                    }

                    override fun onRewindClicked() {
                        // Do something when the rewind button is clicked
                    }

                    override fun onFastForwardClicked() {
                        // Do something when the fast forward button is clicked
                    }

                    override fun onFullscreenClicked() {
                        // Do something when the fullscreen button is clicked
                    }

                    override fun onSeekBarProgressChanged(progressMs: Long) {
                        // Do something when the progress SeekBar is changed by click or a drag event
                    }
	})
	
// Using the MediaControllerListenerAdapter interface with only onPlayClicked and onPauseClicked methods
fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
	.mediaControllerListener(object : MediaControllerListenerAdapter() {
		    override fun onPlayClicked() {
			// Do something when the play button is clicked
                    }

                    override fun onPauseClicked() {
			// Do something when the pause button is clicked
                    }
	})
```

### Seek to position

Seek to a selected position by calling the `seekTo` method and passing the time in milliseconds to it.

```
fullscreenVideoView.videoUrl(videoUrl)
	.seekTo(5000)
```

### Change the video URL at runtime

Change the video URL by calling `changeUrl` method of `FullscreenVideoView` and passing the new URL.

```
fullscreenVideoView.changeUrl(videoUrl)
```

### Listen for video completion

Listen for video completion event by calling the `addOnVideoCompletedListener` and passing an instance of `OnVideoCompletedListener`.

```
fullscreenVideoView.addOnVideoCompletedListener {
    // Do something when the video is completed
}
```
