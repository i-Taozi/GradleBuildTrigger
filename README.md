# ApkTrack

#### Check for updates on PlayStore and other sources

ApkTrack checks, if updates for installed apps are available.

It was created for users, who do not want use Google PlayStore, but still would like to be informed when new versions of their installed applications are available.  ApkTrack performs simple website scraping to obtain the latest version information of APKs present on a device.  It can query F-Droid, PlayStore, Xposed, plus many other sources of APKs via the ApkTrack Proxy.

## Usage

![ApkTrack screenshot](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/161407screenshot.png)

* Click on an application in the list of installed apps to perform a manual update check for this APK.
* Buttons in ApkTrack's window header (i.e. at the top of its main page):
   * The leftmost button searches for a specific app in the application list.
   * The middle button performs an update check for *all* applications.
   * The rightmost button offers additional options, such as sorting.  ApkTrack's settings are also accessible via this menu.
* Apps with their version information displayed in red are outdated.  Tap on the magnifying glass icon to search for the latest APK with your favorite search engine, which is configurable in ApkTrack's settings.
* Swiping an application entry in the list of installed apps to the left or right removes it from the list and hence excludes it from being queried for updates.  Such an exclusion can be reverted in ApkTrack's settings.
* Apps can also be excluded by category (e.g. system apps, Xposed apps, unknown apps) in the settings.
* ApkTrack can be configured to use a network proxy in its settings.
* ApkTrack's settings also offer to delete the APKs it downloaded.

That's it.

## Things to keep in mind

* Applications are *not* updated automatically.  ApkTrack may provide a direct link to the latest APK available, but in general users are expected to download APKs by themselves.
* ApkTrack uses regular expressions to scrape webpages, so it may cease to work without notice if a source website is modified.
* Although there is a background service checking for updates every day, it may get killed by the OS.  Remember to check for updates manually from time to time, i.e. by hitting the middle button in ApkTrack's window header.
