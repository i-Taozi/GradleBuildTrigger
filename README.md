Putnami Gradle Plugin
---------------------

This plugin helps to build GWT project with Gradle. The main goals is build webapps and libraries.

**Why to use it?**

* DevMode on standalone Jetty 9 container.
* DevMode works with multi module project.
* Ease of use.
* Gradle is faster and easier than Maven

## Requirements ##

* Java 7 or higher.
* Gradle 4 or higher. https://gradle.org

## Quick start ##

* First you need java and gradle installed on your workstation.
* Init your project with this structure

```
/ build.gradle
/ src
  |-- main
    |-- java
    |-- resources
    |-- webapp
```

* You can init the project with those commands

```sh
PROJECT_NAME={your-project}
mkdir $PROJECT_NAME
cd $PROJECT_NAME
mkdir -p src/main/java src/main/resources src/main/webapp
mkdir -p src/test/java src/test/resources
touch build.gradle
```


* Apply the plugin **fr.putnami.gwt** in your *build.gradle* file

To apply the plugin, please add one of the following snippets to your *build.gradle* file:

**Gradle >= 2.1**

```groovy
plugins {
    id "fr.putnami.gwt" version "0.4.0"
}
```

Currently the "plugins" notation cannot be used for applying the plugin for sub projects, when used from the root build script.

**Gradle < 2.1**

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'fr.putnami.gwt:putnami-gradle-plugin:0.4.0'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'fr.putnami.gwt'
```

If you have a multi project build make sure to apply the plugin and the plugin configuration to every project.

* Then use the commands below:
  * `gradle gwtRun` To run the webapp
  * `gradle gwtDev` To run the DevMode
  * `gradle build`  To compile GWT and Build the webapp


**Notes**

To use the lastest **snapshot** you can add `maven{ url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/' }` to the buildscript repositories.

### On eclipse ###

* Get [Gradle Integration for Eclipse](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gradle-integration-eclipse-44)
* Go to the eclipse navigator by opening eclipse and going to Window>Show View>Navigator
* Create a new java project
* Add a file to the project and name it build.gradle
* In the src folder add the following directory structure:
```
/ src
  |-- main
    |-- java
    |-- webapp
```

* In the `build.gradle` file put:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'eclipse'
plugins {
  id "fr.putnami.gwt" version "0.4.0"
}

repositories {
	mavenCentral()
}

putnami{
	module 'your.gwt.module.to.compile'
	/** add gwt nature on eclipse projec. require apply plugin: 'eclipse' to work. default : false*/
	googlePluginEclipse = true
}
```


* right click on the project and configure>convert to Gradle project
* Go to Window>Show View>Other>gradle tasks. In the gradle tasks window double click eclipse.
* Make sure that the GPE(Google Plugin for Eclipse) is installed.
* Right click on your project and go to Properties>google>Web Application
* Check the check box labeled this project has a war directory and select src/main/webapp as your war directory.
* Then go to the properties for web toolkit. Check the check box labeled use Google Web Toolkit. Make sure not to use an SDK from before 2.7.0. Add all of your gwt entry point modules. To tell the plugin to gwt compile right click your project and go to google>gwt compile, add all of your modules and click compile.


## Samples ##

We offer you 3 build samples:

* **Library project** : Simple library project [pgp-sample-lib](https://github.com/Putnami/putnami-gradle-plugin/tree/master/samples/pgp-sample-lib).
* **WebApp project** : Simple GWT project [pgp-sample-webapp](https://github.com/Putnami/putnami-gradle-plugin/tree/master/samples/pgp-sample-webapp).
* **Multi-modules project** : Project composed with a library and a webapp [pgp-sample-multimodules](https://github.com/Putnami/putnami-gradle-plugin/tree/master/samples/pgp-sample-multimodules).


## Advanced usages ##

### Plugins ###

The Putnami Gradle Plugin is usefull either to build GWT's library or webapp.

* apply plugin: **'fr.putnami.gwt-lib'** : To build a library. This plugin installs properly all the GWT dependencies on your project and adds the java sources into the target jar artifact.
* apply plugin: **'fr.putnami.gwt'** : To build a webapp. This plugin installs properly all the GWT dependencies and provide all the usefull tasks helping you to work efficiently on your projects.

### Debug server side ###

To debug the server side (jetty), you can use the the below configuration then run ``gradle gwtDev`` and attach a remote debugger with your favorite IDE.


```groovy
putnami{
    jetty {
        /** enable debugging. */
        debugJava = true
        /** debug port to listen. */
        debugPort = 8000
        /** wait for debugger attachment. */
        debugSuspend = false
    }
}
```

### Debug client side ###

The first way to debug the client side is to use the developer tools of your browsers. All modern browser provide powerfull tools to browse and put breakpoint on the java sources exposed by GWT code server.

You can also use the eclipse plugin SDBG ( http://sdbg.github.io/) to debug in your IDE. Once the plugin installed you have to:

1. run the task ``gwtDev`` or ``gwtCodeServer``
2. in the eclipse debug configuration add a launch chrome.
3. set the url (I.E. http://localhost:8080/)
4. set the project where the sources are.
5. Run the configuration
6. Add some breakpoints.

And enjoy.


### Tasks and configuration ###

* Common configuration

```groovy
putnami{
	/** Module to compile, can be multiple */
	module 'fr.putnami.gradle.sample.multimodule.app.App'

	/** GWT version */
	gwtVersion = "2.7.0"
	/** Add the gwt-servlet lib */
	gwtServletLib = true
	/** Add the gwt-elemental lib */
	gwtElementalLib = false
	/** Jetty version */
	jettyVersion = "9.2.7.v20150116"
}
```

* **gwtCompile** Compile the GWT webapp.

Can be tuned with the following parametters:

```groovy
putnami{
	compile {
		/** The level of logging detail (ERROR, WARN, INFO, TRACE, DEBUG, SPAM, ALL) */
		logLevel = "INFO"
		/** Compile a report that tells the "Story of Your Compile". */
		compileReport = true
		/** Compile quickly with minimal optimizations. */
		draftCompile = true
		/** Include assert statements in compiled output. */
		checkAssertions = false
		/** Script output style. (OBF, PRETTY, DETAILED)*/
		style = "OBF"
		/** Sets the optimization level used by the compiler. 0=none 9=maximum. */
		optimize = 5
		/** Fail compilation if any input file contains an error. */
		failOnError = false
		/** Specifies Java source level. ("1.6", "1.7")*/
		sourceLevel = "1.7"
		/** The number of local workers to use when compiling permutations. */
		localWorkers = 2
		/** The number of local workers to use when compiling permutations. */
		localWorkersMem = 2048
		/** Emit extra information allow chrome dev tools to display Java identifiers in many places instead of JavaScript functions. (NONE, ONLY_METHOD_NAME, ABBREVIATED, FULL)*/
		methodNameDisplayMode = "NONE"
		/** Specifies JsInterop mode (NONE, JS, CLOSURE). JsInterop Experimental (GWT 2.7) */
		jsInteropMode = "JS"
		/** Generate and export JsInterop (since GWT 2.8) */
		generateJsInteropExports = true

		/** Extra args can be used to experiment arguments */
		extraArgs = ["-firstArgument", "-secondArgument"]

		/** shown all compile errors */
        strict = false

		/** Java args */
		maxHeapSize="1024m"
		minHeapSize="512m"
		maxPermSize="128m"
		debugJava = true
		debugPort = 8000
		debugSuspend = false
		javaArgs = ["-Xmx256m", "-Xms256m"]
	}
}
```

* **gwtRun** Compile the GWT webapp and run the jar on Jetty 9


**Note :** This task depends on the gwtCompile task.

Can be tuned with the following parametters:

```groovy
putnami{
	jetty {
		/** interface to listen on. */
		bindAddress = "127.0.0.1"
		/** request log filename. */
		logRequestFile
		/** info/warn/debug log filename. */
		logFile
		/** port to listen on. */
		port = 8080
		/** port to listen for stop command. */
		stopPort = 8089
		/** security string for stop command. */
		stopKey = "JETTY-STOP"

		/** Java args */
		maxHeapSize="1024m"
		minHeapSize="512m"
		maxPermSize="128m"
		debugJava = true
		debugPort = 8000
		debugSuspend = false
		javaArgs = ["-Xmx256m", "-Xms256m"]
	}
}
```

* **gwtDev** Run the CodeServer (SDM) and Jetty 9

The SDM is tuned with the following parametters, the jetty is configured from the previous configuration.

```groovy
putnami{
	dev {
		/** The ip address of the code server. */
		bindAddress = "127.0.0.1"
		/** Stop compiling if a module has a Java file with a compile error, even if unused. */
		failOnError = false
		/** Precompile modules. */
		precompile = false
		/** The port where the code server will run. */
		port = 9876
		/** EXPERIMENTAL: Don't implicitly depend on "client" and "public" when a module doesn't define anydependencies. */
		enforceStrictResources = false
		/** Specifies Java source level ("1.6", "1.7").
		sourceLevel = "1.6"
		/** The level of logging detail (ERROR, WARN, INFO, TRACE, DEBUG, SPAM, ALL) */
		logLevel = "INFO"
		/** Specifies JsInterop mode (NONE, JS, CLOSURE). JsInterop Experimental (GWT 2.7) */
		jsInteropMode = "JS"
		/** Generate and export JsInterop (since GWT 2.8) */
		generateJsInteropExports = true
		/** Emit extra information allow chrome dev tools to display Java identifiers in many placesinstead of JavaScript functions. (NONE, ONLY_METHOD_NAME, ABBREVIATED, FULL) */
		methodNameDisplayMode = "NONE"
		/** shown all compile errors */
        strict = false
        /** disable this internal server */
        noServer = false

		/** Extra args can be used to experiment arguments */
		extraArgs = ["-firstArgument", "-secondArgument"]

		/** Java args */
		maxHeapSize="1024m"
		minHeapSize="512m"
		maxPermSize="128m"
		debugJava = true
		debugPort = 8000
		debugSuspend = false
		javaArgs = ["-Xmx256m", "-Xms256m"]
	}
}
