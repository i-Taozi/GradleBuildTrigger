= Dolphin Platform release documentation
The sources of the Dolphin Platform are seperated in several repositories:

* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform[GitHub repository of the Java API]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-js[GitHub repository of the JavaScript basic client API]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-polymer[GitHub repository of the Polymer client API]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-angularjs[GitHub repository of the AngularJS client API]

In addition we provide several repositories that contain jumpstarts for the Dolphin Platform. This repositories
should be released with each release of the Dolphin Platform:

* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-lazybones-templates[Dolphin Platform Lazybones template for a Spring
based jumpstart]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-spring-boot-archetype[Dolphin Platform Maven archetype for a Spring
based jumpstart]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-kumuluz-archetype[Dolphin Platform Maven archetype for a JavaEE
based jumpstart]

Based on this seperation a release for the Dolphin Platform is more complex than a release for a framework that is based
on one single repository.

There are 2 different release types for the Dolphin Platform:
* The regular (major) release introduces new features and / or bugfixes. We currently try to create such a release in a
periode of 2 weeks. This release will be created from the master branches of all repositories.
* A bugfix (minor) release provides a critical bugfix and will be created based on a regular /major Dolphin Platform
release. This release will normally be based on the release branch of the major release.

To manage releases and the containing issues we use waffle.io as kanban board. You can find it
https://waffle.io/canoo/dolphin-platform[here]

== Major and Minor Release of the Dolphin Platform

This chapter describes how a new major or minor release for the Dolphin Platform can be created.

IMPORTANT: When doing a *major* release of the Dolphin Platform the first or second number in the version number should be updated.
Based on this the next major release after `0.9.0` will be `0.10.0` and after `1.2.0` the next release will be `1.3.0`.

IMPORTANT: When doing a *minor* release of the Dolphin Platform the third number in the version number should be updated.
Based on this the next minor release after `0.9.0` will be `0.9.1` and after `1.2.1` the next release will be `1.2.2`.

=== Release process

The releases must be done in a pre-defined order.
Even if you don't have changes in some of the projects. The project version should be updated.

The order is:

1. *JavaScript basic API*
2. JavaScript Frameworks (*AngularJS API* and *Poylmer API*)
3. Java examples (currently part of the Java API repository)
4. Java API

*Why is the order important?*

The *JavaScript basic API* has no dependency to the other projects, but
the JavaScript Frameworks depend on the *JavaScript basic API*.
The Java Examples depend on the JavaScript Frameworks.
And last but not least, the *Java API* currently depends on the Java examples.

There are two ways to create a release. A script-based process and a manual process.

==== Script-based process

The Dolphin Platform provides a shell script to create a release for the different parts of the project.
Currently only UNIX based operation systems are supported by the shell script.
The script is located in the Java repository inside the _scripts_ folder.

The repositories for all projects should be available in the same folder.

[source,shell]
----
user@system ~ $ ls -laG
total 6
drwxr-xr-x  11 user  group   352 15 Feb 16:04 .

----

The script expects some parameters. Calling the script without a parameter will print the help information.

[source,shell]
----
Usage: prepare-release <package> <version> [candidate]

package:    Possible packages are: javascript, js-frameworks, java-examples, java
version:    The release version number in the format major.minor.patch, e.g. 1.0.0
candidate:  Optional release candidate number, e.g 4
----

CAUTION: The script *must* be called outside the project directories because of the relative paths used in the script.

===== Exmaple

For version 1.0.0 with release candidate 4 the following command should be executed in the given order:

    user@system ~ $ pwd
    /home/user
    user@system ~ $ dolphin-platform/scripts/prepare-release javascript 1.0.0 4
    ...
    user@system ~ $ dolphin-platform/scripts/prepare-release js-frameworks 1.0.0 4
    ...
    user@system ~ $ dolphin-platform/scripts/prepare-release java-examples 1.0.0 4
    ...
    user@system ~ $ dolphin-platform/scripts/prepare-release java 1.0.0 4
    ...

This will release *JavaScript basic API* and JavaScript Frameworks as `1.0.0-CR.4` and Java examples and *Java API* as `1.0.0.CR4`

Full example output for the realase of *JavaScript basic API* as `1.0.0-CR.4`

[source,shell]
----
user@system ~ $ dolphin-platform/scripts/prepare-release javascript 1.0.0 4
Dolphin Platform Release preparation v1.0.0 (2018-02-15)

Release will be created as version: 1.0.0, Release Candidate 4

Java version will be: 1.0.0.CR4
JavaScript versions will be: 1.0.0-CR.4

==== Manual step by step process

CAUTION: For a release the repositories shoud be released in a defined order to create a accurate release. The following
         documentation shows a step by step instruction to release all repositories. In general a release starts by releasing
         the sources of the *JavaScript basic API* repositories followed by the JavaScript Frameworks and the Java repository. Once this is done the jumpstart related
         repositories can be released in any order.

===== Releasing the JavaScript basic API
A developer *must* always start to release the *JavaScript basic API*. To do so several steps are needed:

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-js[JavaScript basic API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* Check out the master branch
* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.10.x`), e.g. `git branch release/1.0.0-CR.4`
* Check out the created release branch, e.g. `git checkout release/1.0.0-CR.4`
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `npm run clean` command must be called to perform a clean up on the folders
* In the root folder of the project the `npm test` command must be called to execute the unit tests
* If the tests executes without any error the new version number for the release must be specified in the following
files: `bower.json`, `package.json`, `sonar-project.properties`
* In the root folder of the project the `npm run build` command must be called to create a new package
* The changed files must be added to the branch, e.g. `git add <file>`
* The changes must be committed, e.g. `git commit -m "Version updated to 1.0.0-CR.4"`
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged, e.g. `git tag 1.0.0-CR.4`. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release.
* The new branch and the new tag must be pushed to the remote repository
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub, the *JavaScript basic API* has been released
* Push the changes to the master branch

===== Releasing the JavaScript Frameworks

As a next step the *Poylmer API* can be released. To do so several steps are needed:

TIP: The *Polymer API* does not contain a build step, because a Polymer component has not build process at all.
Only a Polymer application contains a build process.

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-polymer[Polymer API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* Check out the master branch
* The dependency of the *JavaScript basic API* (`dolphin-platform-js`) must be set to the new version in the `bower.json` file
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `bower install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the bower dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `npm run lint` command must be called so Polymer can check the component
* In the root folder of the project the `npm test` command must be called to execute the browser-based unit tests
* The new version number for the release must be specified in the following
files: `bower.json`, `package.json`, package-lock.json` and `sonar-project.properties` (currently
`sonar-project.properties` is not part of the project)
* If all is running commit all changes to master
* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.10.x`), e.g. `git branch release/1.0.0-CR.4`
* Check out the created release branch, e.g. `git checkout release/1.0.0-CR.4`
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged, e.g. `git tag 1.0.0-CR.4`. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release.
* The new branch and the new tag must be pushed to the remote repository
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub the *Polymer basic API* has been released
* Push the changes to the master branch

As a next step the *AngularJS API* can be released. To do so several steps are needed:

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-angularjs[AngularJS API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* Check out the master branch
* The dependency of the *JavaScript basic API* (`dolphin-platform-js`) must be set to the new version in the `bower.json` file
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `bower install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the bower dependencies
* The new version number for the release must be specified in the following
files: `bower.json`, `package.json` and `sonar-project.properties`
* As a next step the project must be build. To do so call `gulp clean verify build` in the root
folder of the project.
* If the build is running commit all changes to master
* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.10.x`), e.g. `git branch release/1.0.0-CR.4`
* Check out the created release branch, e.g. `git checkout release/1.0.0-CR.4`
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged, e.g. `git tag 1.0.0-CR.4`. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release.
* The new branch and the new tag must be pushed to the remote repository
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub the *AngularJS API* has been released
* Push the changes to the master branch


===== Releasing the Java repository

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform[Java repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* Check out the master branch
* Update the dependencies to the JavaScript Fameworks of all web-based client modules in the `platform-examples` folder to the new version (in the `bower.json` file)
* Start and check all examples (mostly the Todo, the Process-Monitor and the Security example)
* Update the he changelog for current release in the documentation.
* Commit the changes to master
* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.10.x`), e.g. `git branch release/1.0.0-CR4`
* Check out the created release branch, e.g. `git checkout release/1.0.0-CR4`
* Call `./gradlew clean build` from the project folder to check that the build is working
* Update the version number in the `gradle.properties` file
* Call `./gradlew clean bintrayUpload` from the project folder. For this step the Bintray user name and API token
must be configured in the gradle.properties file (`/userHome/.gradle/gradle.properties`). Add the properties `bintrayUsername` and `bintrayApiKey` to the file.
* Create a tag from the release branch, e.g. `git tag 1.0.0-CR4` The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.10.0`
* The new branch and the new tag must be pushed to the remote repository
* If this release changed the first number in the version number (like 1.X.X -> 2.X.X) we need to update the SNAPSHOT version in the master
* Push the changes to the master branch
* Login to Bintray and publish all artifacts to JCenter and Maven Central

===== Releasing the jumpstart repository

IMPORTANT: This steps apply to both jumpstart repositories

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-spring-boot-archetype[SpringBoot jumpstart repository] or the https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-kumuluz-archetype[Kumuluz jumpstart repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* Change the version number of Dolphin Platform in `src/main/resources/archetype-resources/pom.xml`
* Change the version number of Dolphin Platform in `src/main/resources/archetype-resources/polymer-client/bower.json`, if available
* Change the version number of Dolphin Platform in `src/main/resources/archetype-resources/angular-client/bower.json`, if available
* Do `mvn clean install`
* Create sample project by calling `mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=com.canoo.dolphin-platform:` in separate folder
* Check everything in the sample project
* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.10.x`), e.g. `git branch release/1.0.0-CR4`
* Check out the created release branch, e.g. `git checkout release/1.0.0-CR4`
* Update version number in main `pom.xml`
*  Call `mvn clean deploy` from the project folder. For step the bintray user name and api token
  must be configured in the `.m2/setting.xml` Maven setting file.
* Create a tag from the release branch, e.g. `git tag 1.0.0-CR4` The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release.
* The new branch and the new tag must be pushed to the remote repository
* Push the changes to the master branch
* Login to Bintray and publish all artifacts to JCenter and Maven Central

===== General release steps

* Next to the release of the software the version numbers of the latest stable should be updated in tutorials and
readme.md files of the repos.
* Create a release in GitHub (see https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform/releases[releases]) with the name of the
released version and copy the changelog for the new version in it
* The milestone in github must be closed (see https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform/milestones[milestones])
