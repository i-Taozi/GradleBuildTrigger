= JavaEE Integration

Even if mostly all of the public server APIs of the Dolphin Platform don't depend on the underlying container
implementation a special dependency must be added to a project that is created as a JavaEE based application.

.Dependencies for a JavaEE based server

The `dolphin-platform-server-javaee` dependency adds the Dolphin Platform server API and JavaEE APIs as transitive
dependencies. For a maven based project a minimum  `pom.xml` looks like this:

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.canoo.sample</groupId>
    <artifactId>server</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.canoo.dolphin-platform</groupId>
            <artifactId>dolphin-platform-remoting-server-javaee</artifactId>
            <version>{dolphin-platform-version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

</project>
----

In most cases you will define the model classes in a separate module that is shared between client and server and server
must be added as a second dependency to your application.
Once you start the server application the Dolphin Platform bootstrap will automatically be initialized.

== Configuration of the application

The Dolphin Platform part of the application can be configured a `dolphin.properties` file. This file is not JavaEE
specific and therefore it's described in the general server part.

== Next steps

When developing a Dolphin Platform application with JavaEE you can use all the benefits of both worlds. This means that
you can simply define CDI beans and inject them in Dolphin Platform controllers. A general overview of the Dolphin
Platform server API can be found here.

== Using the jumpstart

Dolphin Platform provides several Maven archetypes to quickly create a full client server application. By doing so you
only need an installed Maven on your system and can run the following command on a shell:

[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=com.canoo.dolphin-platform:
----

This will start a Maven build that creates a full client-server Maven project for you. A full documentation of the
jumpstart can be found here.

== Supported JavaEE containers / application servers

Since the Dolphin Platform depend only on the JavaEE spec it should run in any JavaEE container
that is compatible with JavaEE 6.
We run several integration tests again Dolphin Platform applications on different application servers
with each buid. Based on this we can check the functionallity of the Dolphin Platform explicit in
a specific application server version. At the moment we run integration tests against the following JavaEE servers:
* TomEE 7.0
* Payara 4.1
* Wildfly 10.1

In future we will add more server versions and types.
