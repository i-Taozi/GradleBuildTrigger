= Dolphin Platform Jumpstart

To get started with Dolphin Platform and create your first client-server-project several Maven archetypes are provided
by Dolphin Platform. Based on this archetypes it's quite easy to create a full functional client-server-application as a
perfect base for your own project or to learn the different APIs of Dolphin Platform by simply experimenting with the
generated project.

== Creating a project with Maven

To create a new project only Maven must be installed on your system. Once Maven is installed you can create a complete
project with only one shell command:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=com.canoo.dolphin-platform:
----

CAUTION: The archetypes are deployed to (http://search.maven.org[Maven Central]) and
(https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter[JCenter]). If you have configured your Maven installation to use a different
repository that do not mirror Maven Central or JCenter your Maven installation might not find the archetypes to generate
a jumpstart.

The command will start a Maven process that creates the new project. To do so you can choose between different options
in a shell wizard:

As a first step you need to choose on what archetype your project should depend. Dolphin Platform provides several
archetypes to create for example projects that use Spring Boot or JavaEE on the server. After you have defined the
archetype you need to select a version of the archetype. This version is related to the Dolphin Platform version the
archetype depends on. Here it's best practice to simply select the last version. As a last step you need to specify
`groupId`, `artifactId` and the `version` of your new project. Once this is done the generation might tackle some time
on the first call since all needed dependencies and plugins are downloaded to your computer. You can simply import the
generated project in any IDE of your choice that supports Maven projects. The generated project contains a readme.md
file that describes how the client and server parts of the project can be started.

== Creating a project with Lazybones

Next to the Maven archetype we provide a https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones[Lazybones] template for application that
are based on the Dolphin Platform. The project and a getting-started
documentation https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-lazybones-templates[can be found at github].


== Creating a project by hand

Maybe some developers don't want to use the Maven archetype to create a new Dolphin Platform based application or want to
integrate the Dolphin Platform in an existing application. Even if the Maven archetype is the fastest way to set up a
startable project it's quite easy to create such an application from scratch.

The API and implementation of the Dolphin Platform is split in several modules. Depending on the application
infrastructure a developer needs to add different modules to the application dependencies. The following diagram
gives an overview of all Dolphin Platform modules:

=== Dolphin Platform on the server

On the server side you can choose between a JavaEE or a Spring integration. Each of this
modules depends on the basic server module of the Dolphin Platform that contains the public
API for the server part. Based on this you only need to add one dependency to your server
application. All modules on the server are full compatible to Java 7 and above.

You can simply integrate Dolphin Platform in a Spring based application. To do so you only need to add the Spring
module. All Java modules of the Dolphin Platform are available at Maven Central and JCenter. The following snippet shows
module dependency as maven and gradle.

Spring module as a Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.canoo.dolphin-platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>dolphin-platform-remoting-server-spring</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.CR3</version>
</dependency>
----

Spring module as a Gradle dependency:

[source,xml]
----
dependencies{
    compile 'com.canoo.dolphin-platform:dolphin-platform-remoting-server-spring:1.0.0.CR3'
}
----


Next to this the Dolphin Platform provides support for JavaEE. The following snippet shows the JavaEE module of the
Dolphin Platform as a Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.canoo.dolphin-platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>dolphin-platform-remoting-server-javaee</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.CR3</version>
</dependency>
----

JavaEE module as a Gradle dependency:

[source,xml]
----
dependencies{
    compile 'com.canoo.dolphin-platform:dolphin-platform-remoting-server-javaee:1.0.0.CR3'
}
----

NOTE: Additional information can be found in the JavaEE and Spring chapter of this documentation.

=== Dolphin Platform on the client

Since all Dolphin Platform modules on the server a written in Java the client modules are written in multiple programming
languages to support as many platforms as possible. Currently you can choose between a Java implementation for Desktop
and mobile clients (JavaFX and Android) and a JavaScript implementation with special API for several JavaScript frameworks
(currently Polymer and AngularJS).

==== Java based clients

For a desktop or Android client a developer only need to add the specific Java modules
of the Dolphin Platform as dependencies to the client project.

The following snippet shows the dependency for a JavaFX based client as a Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.canoo.dolphin-platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>dolphin-platform-remoting-client-javafx</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.CR3</version>
</dependency>
----

If you want to create a Android application you need to add the following dependency to your
application:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.canoo.dolphin-platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>dolphin-platform-client-android</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.9</version>
</dependency>
----
