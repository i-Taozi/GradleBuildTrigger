= How to build the Dolphin Platform
:gradle-version: 2.12

The Dolphin Platform build requires link:http://gradle.org/[Gradle] to build itself. The following
sections describe everything you need to know to get started and build a working version of the
software.

== Prerequisites

You must meet the following requirements:

 * JDK8u40 as a minimum
 * Gradle {gradle-version}

You may used the included gradle wrapper script if you don't have `gradle` installed.

== Installing Gradle

.Manual

 . Download Gradle from http://gradle.org/downloads
 . Unzip the file into a directory without spaces (recommended).
 . Create a GRADLE_HOME environment variable that points to this directory.
 . Adjust your PATH environment variable to include $GRADLE_HOME/bin (%GRADLE_HOME%\bin on Windows).
 . Test your setup by invoking `gradle --version`.

.SDKMAN

 . Follow the instructions found at http://sdkman.io/ to install SDKMAN.
 . You need a POSIX environment if running Windows. We recommend using Babun Shell (http://babun.github.io/)
 . Once SDKMAN is installed invoke `sdk install gradle {gradle-version}`.
 . Test your setup by invoking `gradle --version`.

.Gdub

GDub is a wrapper script that facilitates invoking gradle tasks anywhere within a Gradle project. It's smart enough
to use the gradle wrapper if available or your global gradle command. This is an optional download.

 . Follow the instructions found at https://github.com/dougborg/gdub to install gdub.
