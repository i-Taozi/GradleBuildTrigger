= Introduction

The Dolphin Platform is a framework that implements the remote presentation model pattern and provides a modern way to create enterprise applications. As you might know there are several of these frameworks out there. So let us start by describing what makes the Dolphin Platform special and why we decided to create it.


== Architecture overview

In the Dolphin Platform, all models will automatically be synchronized between client and server. Thus, you don't need to think about any specific endpoints or requests.

Based on this, the Dolphin Platform defines server side controllers that contain all the controller logic for a specific view. The lifecycle of these controllers is automatically synchronized with the view lifecycle. With this approach you have a MVC group for each client view with a synchronized model and a managed controller.

The Dolphin Platform provides a server and client framework that let you easily write applications based on the described pattern. To do so the platform contains support for well known sever framework like JavaEE or Spring and several implementations to create clients by using for example JavaFX or Polymer.

== Sources

The Dolphin Platform provides implementations fo several platforms. Therefore the APIs
and implementations of the Dolphin Platform can be found in several GitHub repositories:

* The Java based server API and the basic client API can be found in the main repository
of the Dolphin Platform. This repository contains the JavaFX client API, this documentation
and some samples, too. The repository can be find https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform[here].
* The Android client API can be found in a https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-android[separate repository].
* For JavaScript the Dolphin Platform provides a basic framework independend implementation
that can be found https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-js[here].
* For Google Polymer the Dolphin Platform provides a client API that is based on the
basic JavaScript cient API. The Polymer client API can be found
https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-polymer[in this repository].
* The Dolphin Platform provides a Maven archetype to create the initial structure of
a Dolphin Platform based project. The sources of the archetype can be found
https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-spring-boot-archetype[here].
* The Dolphin Platform provides a Lazybones template to create the initial structure of
a Dolphin Platform based project. The sources of the template can be found
https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-lazybones-templates[here].
