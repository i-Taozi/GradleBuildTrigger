= Server configuration

The Dolphin Platform can simply be configured by a property file. To configure the server part of the Dolphin Platform
a `dolphin.properties`-file must be created in the `META-INF` folder. In a Maven based project the file would be defined
as `project/src/main/resources/META-INF/dolphin.properties`. This file must be defined as a regular Java property file.
Here is an example how such a file might look:
[source,txt]
----
useCrossSiteOriginFilter=true

== Supported properties

Currently the following properties are supported by the Dolphin Platform:

.Table title
|===
|Name |Description |Supported values |Default value

|useCrossSiteOriginFilter
|Boolean property that defines if the HTTP filter for the cross site origin policy should be used. By default the filter
will be used.
|true, false
|true

|accessControlAllowHeaders
|List of String headers which needs to be allowed with Access-Control-Allow-Headers for the cross site origin policy.
 See here - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
|Content-Type, x-requested-with, origin, authorization, accept, client-security-token
|Content-Type, x-requested-with, origin, authorization, accept, client-security-token

|accessControlAllowMethods
|List of Methods which needs to be allowed with Access-Control-Allow-Methods for the cross site origin policy.

|accessControlAllowCredentials

 are allowed. See here - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
|true, false
|true

|accessControlMaxAge
|Long property that defines Access-Control-Max-Age for the cross site origin policy.
 are allowed. See here - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
|timestamp Long value
|86400

|useSessionInvalidationServlet
|Boolean property that defines if the servlet for session validation should be used. By default the servlet will not be used. We plan to remove the servlet completelly in a future release and this property is just for a fallback if not using the servelt will end in issues.
|true, false
|false

|servletMapping
|A string based property that defines the server URL endpoint for the Dolphin Platform.
|any String that defines an URL mapping
|/dolphin

|sessionTimeout
|A int that defines the http session timeout in seconds
|any integer value
|900

|idFilterUrlMappings
|A list that contains all endpoint that will be filtered by the id filter. This means that all requests for this
endpoints must provide a client id in its header (Header name = dolphin_platform_intern_dolphinClientId).
|a comma seperated list
|/dolphin

|maxClientsPerSession
|Defines how many clients can exist in a http session. By using the client scope you can have several clients that share
a session but don't use the same data (by using the client scope / dolphin session). By doing so several tabs in a
browser can handle its own clients
|any positive integer value
|10

|rootPackageForClasspathScan
|Defines the root package that should be used to scan the classpath for Dolphin Platform controllers. By default all
classes in the classpath will be scanned but this might take some time in big projects. By defining a root package all
classes that are located in this package or any subpackage of the root package will be scanned.
|a String that matches the java package structure like "com.canoo" or a empty string if the complete classpath should be
scanned.
|NULL (scan complete classpath)

|mBeanRegistration
|Defines if the Dolphin Platform will register custom MBeans to provide information about the platform and the sessions
|true, false
|true

|garbageCollectionActive
|By activating the garbage collection the Dolphin Platform checks internally if Dolphin beans are referenced (for example
in a Dolphin Bean hierarchy). If not this beans will automatically be removed on the server and the client. This is an
unstable feature at the moment and should only be activated for tests.
|true, false
|true

|maxPollTime
|Defines the timeout of the Dolphin Platform polling mechanism that is used for the event bus and for the session.runLater
call.
|any long
|5000

|active
|Defines if the Dolphin Platform should be bootstraped at the start of the server
|true, false
|true
