= Spring Integration

Even if mostly all of the public server APIs of the Dolphin Platform don't depend on the underlying container
implementation a special dependency must be added to a project that is created as a Spring (Boot) application.

.Dependencies for a Spring based server
image::spring-dependency.png[]

The `dolphin-platform-server-spring` dependency adds the Dolphin Platform server API and Spring as transitive
dependencies. For a maven based project a minimum  `pom.xml` looks like this:

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.canoo.sample</groupId>
    <artifactId>server</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.canoo.dolphin-platform</groupId>
            <artifactId>dolphin-platform-remoting-server-spring</artifactId>
            <version>{dolphin-platform-version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

</project>
----

In most cases you will define the model classes in a separate module that is shared between client and server and server
must be added as a second dependency to your application.

== Defining the main class of the application

To start your Spring Boot based server a class with a main method need be be defined. In the main method Spring must be
started. In addition the Dolphin Platform bootstrap must be configured and initialized. To do so Dolphin Platform
provides the `@DolphinPlatformApplication` annotation that must be added to the main class to automatically load all
needed configurations and trigger the Dolphin Platform Bootstrap. Based on the annotation a main class will always looks
like this:

[source,java]
----
@DolphinPlatformApplication
public class ServerMain {

    public static void main(String... args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ServerMain.class, args);
    }

}
----

== Configuration of the application

The server application can be configured by using all the possibilities that Spring offers for configuration. In
addition a `dolphin.properties` file can be used to define a configuration for the Dolphin Platform part of the server.
This file is not Spring specific and therefore it's described in the general server part.

== Provide configuration of the Dolphin Platform by Spring Boot

The default `application.properties` file for Spring Boot configuration
(or any other valid Spring Boot configuration file or provider) can be used
to configure the Dolphin Platform. In this case a developer do not need to
create a `dolphin.properties` file. All configurations can easily be defined
in the `application.properties`. In that case the `dolphinPlatform.` prefix
is needed for all configuration properties of the Dolphin Platform.

To following table gives an overview of all Dolphin Platform related properties
that can be configured by using Spring configuration (like `application.properties` file):

|===
|Name |Description |Supported values |Default value

|dolphinPlatform.useCrossSiteOriginFilter
|Boolean property that defines if the HTTP filter for the cross site origin policy should be used. By default the filter
will be used.
|true, false
|true

|dolphinPlatform.useSessionInvalidationServlet
|Boolean property that defines if the servlet for session validation should be used. By default the servlet will not be used. We plan to remove the servlet completelly in a future release and this property is just for a fallback if not using the servelt will end in issues.
|true, false
|false

|dolphinPlatform.dolphinPlatformServletMapping
|A string based property that defines the server URL endpoint for the Dolphin Platform.
|any String that defines an URL mapping
|/dolphin

|dolphinPlatform.sessionTimeout
|A int that defines the http session timeout in seconds
|any integer value
|900

|dolphinPlatform.idFilterUrlMappings
|A list that contains all endpoint that will be filtered by the id filter. This means that all requests for this
endpoints must provide a client id in its header (Header name = dolphin_platform_intern_dolphinClientId).
|a comma seperated list
|/dolphin

|dolphinPlatform.maxClientsPerSession
|Defines how many clients can exist in a http session. By using the client scope you can have several clients that share
a session but don't use the same data (by using the client scope / dolphin session). By doing so several tabs in a
browser can handle its own clients
|any positive integer value
|10

|dolphinPlatform.rootPackageForClasspathScan
|Defines the root package that should be used to scan the classpath for Dolphin Platform controllers. By default all
classes in the classpath will be scanned but this might take some time in big projects. By defining a root package all
classes that are located in this package or any subpackage of the root package will be scanned.
|a String that matches the java package structure like "com.canoo" or a empty string if the complete classpath should be
scanned.
|NULL (scan complete classpath)

|dolphinPlatform.mBeanRegistration
|Defines if the Dolphin Platform will register custom MBeans to provide information about the platform and the sessions
|true, false
|true

|dolphinPlatform.useGc
|By activating the garbage collection the Dolphin Platform checks internally if Dolphin beans are referenced (for example
in a Dolphin Bean hierarchy). If not this beans will automatically be removed on the server and the client. This is an
unstable feature at the moment and should only be activated for tests.
|true, false
|true

|dolphinPlatform.maxPollTime
|Defines the timeout of the Dolphin Platform polling mechanism that is used for the event bus and for the session.runLater
call.
|any long
|5000

|active
|Defines if the Dolphin Platform should be bootstraped at the start of the server
|true, false
|true
|===



== Next steps

When developing a Dolphin Platform application with Spring you can use all the benefits of both worlds. This means that
you can simply define Spring components and service and inject them in Dolphin Platform controllers. A general overview
of the Dolphin Platform server API can be found here.

== Using the jumpstart

Dolphin Platform provides several Maven archetypes to quickly create a full client server application. By doing so you
only need an installed Maven on your system and can run the following command on a shell:

[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=com.canoo.dolphin-platform:
----

This will start a Maven build that creates a full client-server Maven project for you. A full documentation of the
jumpstart can be found here.
