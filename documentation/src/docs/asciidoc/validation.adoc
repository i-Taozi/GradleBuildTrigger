= Validation Support
The Dolphin Platform provides the optional `dolphin-platform-bean-validation` module that adds http://beanvalidation.org/[Java Bean Validation]
(JSR 303) support to the model layer of the Dolphin Platform. To use the validation support the module must be added as
a dependency to your project:

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.canoo.dolphin-platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>dolphin-platform-bean-validation</artifactId>
    <version>{dolphin-platform-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

If you have defined a common module that contains the model descriptions and is shared between client and server you can
simply replace the `dolphin-platform-core` dependency with `dolphin-platform-bean-validation` since the validation module
adds a transitive dependency to the core module.

The `dolphin-platform-bean-validation` module doesn't depend on a JSR-303 implementation. If your application server don't
provide an implementation you need to add for example Hibernate Validation as a dependency. Here is an example for Maven:

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.3.Final</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.el</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

If you depend on JavaEE your application container will automatically provide an implementation for you. In that case you
don't need to add a specific implementation as a dependency.

== Using validation constraints

Once the module is added as a dependency the contrains annotations of JSR-303 can be used in Dolphin Platform models.
To do so the `Property` fields of a model bean must be annotated with the contrains annotations. Here is an example that
defines a "not null" constrain for a `String` property:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingBean
public class MyModel {

    @NotNull
    private Property<String> value;

    public Property<String> valueProperty() {
        return value1;
    }
}
----

A general description of the Dolphin Platform model API can be found here.

== Validate a model

By using a validator you can now easily validate instances of the model as described in the bean validation documentation
or several tutorials. Here is a basic code snippet that creates a validator by hand and validates a Dolphin Platform model:

[source,java]
----
Configuration<?> validationConf = Validation.byDefaultProvider().configure();

Validator validator = validationConf.buildValidatorFactory().getValidator();

Set<ConstraintViolation<TestBean>> violations = validator.validate(dolphinModel);
if(!violations.isEmpty()) {
    //Handle violations
}
----

Some platforms provide injection of a `Validator` instance. In that case you don't need to create a configuration and
validator by hand.
