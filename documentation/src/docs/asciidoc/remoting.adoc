= The remoting layer

Currently the Dolphin Platform use HTTP long polling internally to provide an asynchronous communication between client
and server. This communication layer defines the base for live views of data or collaborative features in the client.
To support a short reaction time the Dolphin Platform uses 2 HTTP request threads for each client. One of this threads
is only used to interrupt an eventual running long poll request.

In a future release of the Dolphin Platform we plan to offer a websocket based remoting layer with fallback to long
polling. By doing so the asynchronous communication between client and server will become faster.
