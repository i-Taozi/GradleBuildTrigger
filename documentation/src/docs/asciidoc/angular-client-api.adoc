= The AngularJS client integration

Based on the generic JavaScript client API the Dolphin Platform provides a client API for AngularJS 1.x (TODO: Link to Angular).
By using this API it's quite easy to create Dolphin Platform based MVC groups based on AngularJS controllers.

== Adding the Dolphin Platform client API to an AngularJS project

As all JavaScript based modules of the Dolphin Platform the AngularJS integration module is published by bower
(TODO: LINK BOWER). Based on this the easiest way to add the module to a JavaScript project can be reached by using
bower for the dependency management of the project. For such a project the module can easily be added as a dependency by
executing the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ bower install --save dolphin-platform-angularjs
----

This command will automatically add the `dolphin-platform-angularjs` module and all its dependecies to the project.

TIP: The Dolphin Platform Jumpstart creates next to several other client implementations an AngularJS based client
for the project that is created by the jumpstart. This can easily be used as a template for a custom Dolphin Platform
client that is based on AngularJS


Since the JavaScript modules of the Dolphin Platform always provide a compiled JavaScript file that contains the module
and all needed dependencies you only need to add one JavaScript file (`dolphin-platform-angular`.js) to your project.
Based on this the sourcecode of a minimal html page that will use AngularJS and the DolphinPlatform might look like this:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>

    <!-- Angular  -->
    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Dolphin-Platform  -->
    <script src="bower_components/dolphin-platform-angularjs/dist/dolphin-platform-angular.min.js"></script>

</head>

<body>
    READY!
</body>
----

== Configuration of the Dolphin Platform with Angular

To use the Dolphin Platform API in AngularJS controllers the `DolphinPlatform` module must be added to the AngularJS application.
In addition a Dolphin Platform client configuration must be provided. The Dolphin Platform integration for AngularJS
provides a `$dolphinConfigProvider` that can be injected in a `config(...)` method for an AngularJS application. This
method is used to configure the connection to the server that will be used and automatically injected by AngularJS.

The following code snippet shows an example how such a configuration can be provided:

[source,html]
----
<script>
    var app = angular.module("MyApp", ["DolphinPlatform"]).config(function ($dolphinConfigProvider) {
        $dolphinConfigProvider.configure({
            DOLPHIN_URL: "http://localhost:8080/dolphin"
        });
    });
</script>

----

Based on this the minimal html source code for an page that creates an AngularJS application with Dolphin Platform support
and configuration might look like this:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>

    <!-- Angular  -->
    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Dolphin-Platform  -->
    <script src="bower_components/dolphin-platform-angularjs/dist/dolphin-platform-angular.min.js"></script>

</head>

<body>

    <!-- Definition of AngularJS application and Dolphin Platform configuration -->
    <script>
        var app = angular.module("MyApp", ["DolphinPlatform"]).config(function ($dolphinConfigProvider) {
            $dolphinConfigProvider.configure({
                DOLPHIN_URL: "http://localhost:8080/dolphin"
            });
        });
    </script>

    READY!
</body>

== Using the Dolphin Platform with Angular

The best practice to use the Dolphin Platform in an AngularJS based application is the useage of Dolphin Platform controller
proxies directly in AngularJS controllers. By doing so each AngularJS controller instance will be connected to a
Dolphin Platform controller instance on the server. To create a Dolphin Platform controller proxy in an AngularJS controller
the client context of Dolphin Platform can be injected in any AngularJS controller.

The following code snippet shows an AngularJS controller that creates a Dolphin Platform controller proxy:

[source,javascript]
----
app.controller("myAngularComponentName", function ($scope, clientContext) {
        clientContext.connect();
        clientContext.createController($scope, 'myDolphinPlatformControllerName');
});
----

The call of the `createController(...)` method returns a Promise that should be used to define the internal logic of
the AngularJS controller and the interoperation with the Dolphin Platform controller.

A developer do not need to take care of the destruction of the Dolphin Platform controller on the server. The AngularJS
controller will automatically start the destruction once the view component is removed from the HTML DOM.

=== Calling actions on the Dolphin Platform controller

The controller proxy instance that is created can easily be used to invoke Dolphin Platform actions (that are defined by
@RemotingAction as descripted in the chapter about the controller API). To do so the controller proxy provides an
`invoke(...)` method.

Let's say we have an AngularJS view that is defined by the following html code:

[source,html]
----
<div ng-controller="MyController">
    <button type="button" ng-click="save()">save</button>
    <button type="button" ng-click="delete()">delete</button>
</div>
----

This view snippet will be bound to an AngularJS controller with the defined name `MyController`. In addition 2 methods
(`save()` and `delete()`) can be called by the view. This 2 methods must be provided by the AngularJS scope of the
controller. The following implementation of the AngularJS controller assumes that the Dolphin Platform controller has
2 Dolphin Platform actions defined. This actions will be invoked by the `save()` and `delete()` methods.

[source,javascript]
----
app.controller("MyController", function ($scope, clientContext) {
        clientContext.createController($scope, 'MyServerController').then(function (controllerProxy) {

            $scope.save = function () {
                controllerProxy.invoke('save');
            };

            $scope.delete = function () {
                controllerProxy.invoke('delete');
            };
        }
});
----

As all the other Dolphin Platform client APIs the AngularJS related one provides the functionality to pass parameters to
the server side action. In all JavaScript based client APIs the parameters can be specified as a JSON object. The
following snippet shows how a Dolphin Platform action can be called with parameters:

[source,javascript]
----
app.controller("MyController", function ($scope, clientContext) {
        clientContext.createController($scope, 'MyServerController').then(function (controllerProxy) {

            $scope.sayHello = function () {
                controllerProxy.invoke('sayHello', {'message': 'Hello from the AngularJS client'});
            };
        }
});
----


The description about the support of custom parameters in a server side Dolphin Platform action can be found in the
chapter about the controller API.
