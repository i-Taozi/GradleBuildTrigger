= Controller API

When using Dolphin Platform the frontend of an application is split into several views. For each view instance in the
client a controller instance is managed in the server.

TIP: The public API of the server layer is defined in the `dolphin-platform-server module`. The JavaDoc of the module can
be found link:javadoc/server/[here]

== Defining a controller

A controller type is defined as a Java class on the server. This is done with the `@RemotingController` annotation. Each
controller class on the server must be annotated by using this annotation to define the class as a Dolphin Platform controller:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController
public class MyViewController {

    //...

}
----

Each controller type / class is marked by an unique identifier. If developers don't specify an identifier on their own
the full name of the controller class is used. In the given example the controller would have the identifier
`com.company.app.controller.MyViewController` (if it's part of the `com.company.app.controller` package). In general
it's a better to specify an identifier for the controller class since refactoring (like moving the controller class in
a different package) can change its identifier. A custom identifier for a controller can simply be defined by using the
`@RemotingController` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController("ViewController1")
public class MyViewController {

    //...

}
----

In this example the controller has the unique identifier `ViewController1`. When defining custom names for the
controllers it's important to always specify a controller name that is unique in the whole application. Since the
identifier is used on the client to access a specific controller type it's best practice to define the controller names
as constants in a module that is shared between client and server (both depend on the module).

All the constants can easily be specified in an interface, for example:

[source,java]
----
public interface ControllerConstants {

    public static final String CONTROLLER1_NAME = "MyViewController";
    
    public static final String CONTROLLER2_NAME = "ViewController2";

}
----

By doing so the constants can easily be used to specify the identifier of a controller:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController(ControllerConstants.CONTROLLER1_NAME)
public class MyViewController {

    //...

}
----

== Defining the model

Since the view and the controller share a model it's important that the controller knows about the model. To do so the
model type must be specified in the controller class. Whenever a controller will be created the model will automatically
be injected in the controller. To define the model in the controller Dolphin Platform provides the `@RemotingModel`
annotation. By using this annotation the related model type can be specified in a controller and simply injected at runtime:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController(ControllerConstants.CONTROLLER1_NAME)
public class MyViewController {

    @RemotingModel
    private MyModel model;

}
----

How a model can be specified and how it can be used on the client and the server can be found in the documentation of
the model API.

IMPORTANT: A Dolphin Platform controller must have exactly 1 model. Using the `@RemotingModel` annotation more than 1
time in a controller will cause an exception at runtime. If you do not define a model (by using `@RemotingModel`) an
exception will be thrown as well.

== Controller actions

Actions are endpoints of the controller that can be triggered by the view. For example this can happen when a user
clicks a button in the client. This button action will then trigger an action in the server controller instance that
maybe stores some date in the database or refreshes the model.

.Calling an action
image::action.png[]

A controller action is defined as a method in the controller that is annotated by `@RemotingAction`:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController(ControllerConstants.CONTROLLER1_NAME)
public class MyViewController {
 
    @RemotingModel
    private MyModel model;
    
    @RemotingAction
    public void onAction() {
        System.out.println("Action was triggered!");
    }

}
----

Because the action will be triggered by the client it must be specified by an identifier. This identifier must be unique
in the given controller type. By default the name of the method will be used but as described for the `@RemotingController`
annotation it's best practice to specify a custom constant name to avoid refactoring issues:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController(ControllerConstants.CONTROLLER1_NAME)
public class MyViewController {
 
    @RemotingModel
    private MyModel model;
    
    @RemotingAction(ControllerConstants.ACTION1_NAME)
    public void onAction() {
        System.out.println("Action was triggered!");
    }

}
----

Sometimes it's necessary to submit parameters to the server action. Like controllers and actions parameters must be
specified by an identifier. To define the identifier for a parameter of the action Dolphin Platform provides the
`@Param` annotation that must be added to each parameter of the action method:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController(ControllerConstants.CONTROLLER1_NAME)
public class MyViewController {
 
    @RemotingModel
    private MyModel model;
    
    @RemotingAction(ControllerConstants.ACTION1_NAME)
    public void onAction(@Param("id") String id) {
        System.out.println("Action was triggered for id " + id);
    }

}
----

Even if in this example only one parameter is defined the Dolphin Platform actions support any count of parameters. Here
it's only important that each parameter has a unique identifier in the context of the action and that the parameters are
of a supported type. Currently Dolphin Platform supports the following types for parameters: `Integer`, `Long`, `Double`,
`Float`, `Boolean`, `String`. It's best practice to not use primitives here since null values are always supported and
can end in an Exception since Java autoboxing can't convert null to a primitive number or boolean. Some additional
common types like `Date` will be added in future releases.

== Benefits of managed controllers

Since a controller is always created and managed by the underlying platform (like Spring or JavaEE) a developer doesn't
need to care about controller and model creation. The last sample already defines a full useable controller that will
automatically be created (and a new model instance will be injected) whenever the related view is created on the client.
Next to this the controller offers all the benefit that a managed beans offers based on the underlying platform. Based
on this it's no problem to use CDI if Dolphin Platform is used in a JavaEE environment. In addition default annotations
like `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` are supported. The following example shows how such a controller could look like:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController(ControllerConstants.CONTROLLER1_NAME)
public class MyViewController {
 
    @RemotingModel
    private MyModel model;
    
    @Inject
    private MyService service;
    
    @PostContruct
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void shutdown() {
        System.out.println("Bye, bye");
    }

}
----

It's important to know that even if a controller instance is a managed object it can not be injected in any other
managed bean. This belongs on some restrictions in the Dolphin Platform Architecture: Even if the lifecycle of a
controller is well defined it's possible to have several instances of the same controller. Let's say your front-end
contains a tabbed pane and you have 2 instances of the same view in this pane. By doing so it's not possible to specify
what controller instance should be injected in bean. For a future release of Dolphin Platform it's planned to define
parent-child-relations between controller instances. Currently the Dolphin Platform event bus should be used for
communication between controllers and / or additional services.

== Definition of the client scope

Dolphin Platform provides an additional custom Scope called `ClientScope`. This scope is currently implemented for
JavaEE and Spring and it's defined as a scope that is "lower than the session scope". This scope is important if you
want to create web applications, for example. Since all the tabs of a browser share the same session it's hard to define
data that is only related to one tab in the browser. In that case the lifecycle of a client scope is bound to a tab in
the browser and ends when the tab will be closed.

.Definition of the client scope
image::clientscope.png[]

For both JavaEE and Spring a `@ClientScoped` annotation is defined that can be used to give any bean the specific scope:

[source,java]
----
@ClientScoped
public class MyLocalStoreService {
 
    private List<String> values = new ArrayList();
    
    public void add(String val) {
        values.add(val);
    }

}
----

The given service can now simply be injected in any controller:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController(ControllerConstants.CONTROLLER1_NAME)
public class MyViewController {
 
    @RemotingModel
    private MyModel model;
    
    @Inject
    private MyLocalStoreService service;
    
}
----

Internally the client scope is defined by an unique identifier that is shared between client and server with each
request. Based on this the scope only "lives" inside a Dolphin Platform request roundtrip. At the moment this means
that beans that are defined for the client scope can only be injected in Dolphin Platform controller classes or classes
that are (transitive) injected in controllers. For a future release we plan to support general HTTP endpoints that can
be called from a client and "live" in the client scope. This will be useful to provide specific content like images or
files to the client.

== Injection of Dolphin Platform specific services

The Dolphin Platform provide several services that can be injected in any managed bean. Since the Dolphin Platform
controllers are managed beans and support dependency injection the Dolphin Platform specific services can be injected in
any controller.

=== The bean manager

The Dolphin Platform bean manager provides methods to manage the model layer. More information about the model layer
and how to use the bean manager can be found in the *Model API* chapter. The bean manager is defined by the
`com.canoo.platform.remoting.BeanManager` interface. Instances are managed objects in the client session scope.

Example:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController
public class MyViewController {

    @Inject
    private BeanManager beanManager;

     //...

}
----

=== The event bus
The Dolphin Platform provides its own event bus that can be used to provide interaction between several sessions or to
access the Dolphin Platform from a background thread or endpoint. The event bus is defined by the
 `com.canoo.platform.remoting.server.event.RemotingEventBus` interface. Instances are managed objects in the application scope.

Example:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController
public class MyViewController {

    @Inject
    private RemotingEventBus eventBus;

     //...

}
----

=== The Dolphin Platform session

The Dolphin Platform offers a service to interact with the client session. To do so the
`com.canoo.platform.server.client.ClientSession` can be injected. The interface provides similar functionallity as the
`javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` interface does for the http session. Instances are managed objects in the client session
scope.

Example:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController
public class MyViewController {

    @Inject
    private DolphinSession session;

     //...

}
----

=== The property binder
The Dolphin Platform provides a way to create binding between properties in the model layer. This bindings can be
created by injecting the com.canoo.platform.remoting.server.binding.PropertyBinder interface. A more detailed description of
bindings can be found in the *Model API* chapter. Instances are managed objects in the client session scope.

Example:

[source,java]
----
@RemotingController
public class MyViewController {

    @Inject
    private PropertyBinder binder;

     //...

}
----

== React on events on the server

The Dolphin Platform provides 2 server side APIs that can be used to react on events on the server. When talking
about events this can mean several different scenarios: A server side controller instance maybe needs to publish some
data to other controller instances or a REST endpoint on the server needs to call the functionallity of controller
instance for one or many clients. Another common scenario is the usageage of background threads and tasks on the server
that are triggered by a Dolphin Platform controller instance and will notify the controller about a calculated behavior
in any future.

One approach to handle this use cases is by using the Dolphin Platform event bus that implements the publish / subscribe
pattern and is automatically provided as a managed bean in Spring and JavaEE. More about the functionallity and the API
of the event bus can be found in the chapter about the Dolphin Platform event bus.
