= The Remote Presentation Model

Remote Presentation Model (RPM) is a software design pattern for implementing user interfaces. Like Model View
Controller (MVC) it divides a module into three parts:

* Model
* View
* Controller

The main difference to MVC is that the Controller part of the RPM pattern is speretated from the view. In a client server
architecture the controller part is mostly defined on the server. By doing so several benefits of server site programming
can be directly used in the controller. In addition the view part is mostly extreme lightweight and can easily be
replaced. Both controller and view know the model and can interact with the model. Since the components RPM pattern can
be seperated on client and server the model must be synchronized between client and server.

Since view and controller can interact with the model it's a best practice to support the observer pattern for the model.
By doing so the view can simply bind its components to properties of the model and the server can react on changes by
simply adding a lister to an observable property.

The Dolphin Platform provides an implementation of the Remote Presentation Model pattern. This documentation provides
descriptions and samples of the public model, controller and view APIs of the Dolphin Platform.
