/**
 * This class is a minimal wrapper for date stored and retrieved from Apple Property List (plist) files.
 *
 * Due to the nature of plists, the interface is very minimal and simply supports the retrieval of the plist root.
 *
 * This root can be any of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>array</li>
 * <li>dict (essentially a Map&lt;String, ?&gt;)</li>
 * <li>data (byte[])</li>
 * <li>date</li>
 * <li>real</li>
 * <li>integer</li>
 * <li>string</li>
 * <li>true</li>
 * <li>false</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * array and dict are both collections that can, in turn, contain the same elements again.
 *
 * Please take a look at the documentation of PropertyListEncoder and PropertyListDecoder for
 * further information how the different Java data types are handled.
 *
 * Further information can be obtained at the following links:
