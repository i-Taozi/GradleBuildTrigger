* storm-graphite includes a GraphiteCodec.java class, that is based on code in GraphiteReporter.java of Coda Hale's
  Metrics library
  (https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/blob/master/metrics-graphite/src/main/java/com/codahale/metrics/graphite/GraphiteReporter.java).
  Unfortunately the relevant functions in GraphiteReporter.java -- format() -- are not exposed as public functions,
  hence we needed to create GraphiteCodec.java to mimic the functionality.
