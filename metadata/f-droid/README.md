# Metadata for [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org)

* [Build Metadata Reference](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Build_Metadata_Reference/)

## Summary

A brief summary of what the application is. Since the summary is only allowed one line on
the list of the F-Droid client, keeping it to within 80 characters will ensure
it fits most screens.

## Description

A full description of the application, relevant to the latest version. This can span multiple
lines  (which should be kept to a maximum of 80 characters), and is terminated by a line
containing a single `.`.

Basic MediaWiki-style formatting can be used. Leaving a blank line starts a new paragraph.
Surrounding text with `''` make it italic, and with `'''` makes it bold.

Links to web addresses can be done using `[http://example.com Text]`.

Bulletted lists are done by simply starting each item with a `*` on a new line,
and numbered lists are the same but using `#`. There is currently no support for
nesting lists - you can have one level only.
