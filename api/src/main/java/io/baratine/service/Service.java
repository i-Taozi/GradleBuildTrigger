/**
 * {@code @Service} marks a Service, which is an object with a single thread.
 * 
 * Method calls to the service are queued in its inbox and 
 * are invoked sequentially by the service thread.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Service("public:///employee")
 * &#64;Startup
 * public class EmployeeService {
 *
 *   List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
 *
 *   public boolean addEmployee(Employee employee) {
 *       employees.add(employee);
 *       return true;
 *   }
 *
 *   public boolean removeEmployee(Employee employee) {
 *       employees.remove(employee);
 *       return true;
 *   }
 *   ...
 *
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <br>
 * 
 * You could bind the above to an interface that looks like this:
 * 
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *  public interface EmployeeServiceNonBlocking {
 *
 *
 *   //Non blocking method
 *   public void addEmployee(Employee employee, Result&lt;Boolean&gt; resultHandler) ;
 *
 *   //Blocking method
 *   public boolean removeEmployee(Employee employee);
 *   
 *   ...
 *
 *}
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * Service address can use "public" space to make service available externally.
