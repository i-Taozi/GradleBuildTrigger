/**
 * Annotation {@code Asset} marks Baratine service as an Asset.
 * <p>
 * Assets can take advantage of automated persistence using {@code Vault}.
 * <p>
 * Asset's field values are stored in the database and loaded into the fields
 * of an asset when Asset is instantiated via one of the {@code Vault} methods or
 * with a lookup via {@code Services} e.g. {@code Services.service(Book.class, "asset-id")}
 * <p>
 * {@code }Lifecycle of an asset is managed by a hosting {@code Vault}. Vault makes sure
 * that fields of the asset are loaded at the right time and that asset goes through a
 * correct lifecycle.
 * <p>
 * Asset's lifecycle starts with Vault allocating an object instance (asset) associated with
 * an id. At this point the asset has its fields set to initial values. Next,
 * Vault loads values from the database and initializes asset's fields with the
 * values loaded from the database.
 * <p>
 * After the fields are loaded method marked with {@code @OnInit} annotation is
 * called ( providing that method is not required ). Asset becomes available to
 * serving requests after @OnInit method finishes.
 * <p>
 * New asset, which has no values in the database, needs to go through creation
 * phase. A specialized 'create' method is responsible for creating an asset.
 * This method will set initial values for asset's fields and make asset available
 * for having its methods called.
 * <p>
 * Create methods must start with 'create' e.g. {@code createBook(title, author)} and
 * be annotated with @Modify.
 * <p>
 * <b>Create</b> method on an Asset must have a corresponding <b>create</b> method
 * in the hosting Vault. <b>Create</b> method is always called on a Vault and must
 * return <b>id</b> of newly created asset.
 * <p>
 * Assets marked with {@code @AutoCreate} annotation go through the <b>create</b>
 * phase implicitly.
 * <p>
 * Lifecycle of an asset can be made accessible internally to the asset using
 * a field of type {@code StateAsset}. This field will be managed internally and
 * it's values are meant for reading only.
