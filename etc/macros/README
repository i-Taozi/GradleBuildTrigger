This directory contains subdirectories with macros.

If you want to create one macro named 'test', you have to create one subdirectory before to store your macro.
For example, ..../macros/myrepo

Then, put your macro file into this directory. This file must be suffixed by '.mc2'
At the end, you should have something like that: ..../macros/myrepo/test.mc2

And to reference your macro in WarpScript, use @myrepo/test
