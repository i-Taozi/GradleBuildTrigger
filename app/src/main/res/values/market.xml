        NOTE: This application is still a work in progress and in the prototype phase.\n
        \n
        AndProx is an Android port of the client for Proxmark 3, an advanced RFID tool. AndProx
        does not require root or special kernel modules! Instead, it uses the Android USB Host
        API.\n
        \n
        You need a Proxmark 3 attached to your Android device in order to use this. This
        software **does not** use any in-built NFC hardware from your Android device.\n
        \n
        AndProx works with the mainline Proxmark 3.1.0 firmware **only**. You will need to flash
        this firmware using your PC to your PM3 before use. Pre-built firmware images are
        available from the AndProx website.\n
        \n
        If your Android device only has a USB Micro-B connector, you need a USB On-The-Go cable to
        connect your Proxmark 3.\n
        \n
        If your Android device only has a USB Type-C connector, you need a USB-C to USB-A dongle to
        connect your Proxmark 3.\n
        \n
        Some devices need to use a "Y cable" to supply extra power. Without it, Proxmark 3 may
        malfunction, especially with HF cards.\n
        \n
        This doesn’t support all the device’s functionality yet, and is still under active
        development.\n
        \n
        The "Internet" permission is used to connect to a PM3 via TCP/IP.\n
        \n
