/**
 * This interface extends the default {@link List} interface and adds the possibility to observe the list.
 * By adding a {@link ListChangeListener} (see {@link #onChanged(ListChangeListener)}) all mutations of the list can be observed.
 * In addition this class provides some convenience methods.
 * <p>
 * The {@link ObservableList} interface is part of the Dolphin Platform model API. Since the lifecylce of models will be
 * managed by the Dolphin Platform the API don't provide a public implementation for this interface. When defining models
 * a developer only need to use the interface like it is already descriped in the {@link Property}
 * class.
 * Like the {@link Property} a {@link ObservableList} can be used in any Dolphin Platform model
 * (see {@link RemotingBean}).
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 *     {@literal @}RemotingBean
 *     public class MyModel {
 *
 *         {@code private ObservableList<String> values;}
 *
 *         {@code public ObservableList<String> getValues() {
 *              return values;
 *          }
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre>
